We are creating a game inspired by games like dwarf fortress, minecraft. We currently focus on creating a map generator to create worlds for the game. The worlds are based on square tiles and should generate realistic worlds covering different biomes, climates and landscapes.

The project is built using typescript. Favoring simple, basic and simple code favoring standard javascript / typescript over complex libraries or frameworks. However libraries which follow similar principles and substantially reduced code size are OK to add.

The UI should be modern, basic and simple on mobile while more detailed and oriented towards power users on desktop. The UI should not mention any technical terminologies.

All specs for the project are placed in the specs. update it accordingly when changing the implementation

When making changes to the map generator, test it using the node js cli in the repo. This is much faster than the browser UI. verify it in the browser only after implementation .
