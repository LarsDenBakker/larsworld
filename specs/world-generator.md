# The generator
- The world generator should be inspired by that of dwarf fortress and minecraft, but it should not use any copyrighted material.
- Maps should always be square.
- Maps should be realistic, the algorithm complete and extensive.
- 3rd party libraries may be used for better implementation.

# Continents
- The world generator should generate world maps containing 1, 2 or 3 continents.
- Each continent is separated by ocean. 
- The distance between continents should be at least 5% of the total map width.
- In total between 25% and 35% of the total map should be ocean. The rest land.

# Tiles types
- The possible tile types are land and ocean.
